## Learning Goals

Kelli's learning goals included becoming more comfortable with React and Router. Isaiah wanted to understand props and state better while practicing building components. Our joint learning goal was to be diligent with our project board and daily check-ins to divide work.

We initially worked together to come up with the architecture for the app. We then chose to mostly divide and conquer the work with daily check-ins to make sure we were on the same page!

It was initially very challenging to switch to Router from conditional rendering. Once we were able to research and understand the differences between the two it was easier to backtrack on conditional rendering and see how to follow the information being passed through Router.
